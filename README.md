# Development of Cloud Native Apps

This is the repo for the different files and LABs developed for the class "Cloud Native Development" imparted by Javier Ca√±adillas.

## LAB1: Intro to Kubernetes
We created a K8s cluster with 3 nodes with HA in a region. Here we tested different things like blue-green deployments.
